# Mollusc

Python development made easy


# Bootstrap

Bootstrap script makes it easy to start development, the objective is to be able to say:

> Just clone the repo and run the bootstrap script and you're good to go

So that developers can just:

    git clone git@github.com:bachew/mollusc.git
    cd mollusc
    ./bootstrap

Because this is bootstrap script, it makes no sense to pip install it, just [copy the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bachew/mollusc/master/bootstrap) into your project.
